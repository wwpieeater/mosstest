20:04:00 <LandrushServer> <fuinur> lag is caused by minetest being very stupid. change 1 node - full 16x16x16 mapblock must be send. and blinky/mesecon/klots of other stuff is actually replacing nodes. also these changes are atacking on server. use drill in 10 places in 1 mapblock - server will send and confirm at least 10 updates to mapblock and inventory - which is idiotic. instead iyt should check that previous update is not sent yet and skip all in middle - sending on
19:59:04 <LandrushServer> <fuinur> textures on server are small already. and liong time is caused by server sending them one-by-one, each needing confirmation. do smaller texture data will stiull need lots of control traffic. this is minetest fault (unless i am very wrong)
